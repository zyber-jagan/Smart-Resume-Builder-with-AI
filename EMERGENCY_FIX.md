# ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY FIX - White Page Issue

## Problem:
App shows white page on GitHub Pages but works on localhost.

## Root Cause:
GitHub Pages deployment might not be working correctly.

## âœ… SOLUTION: Manual Deployment

Since GitHub Actions isn't deploying properly, let's deploy the built files manually:

### Step 1: Copy Built Files to Root

```powershell
# Copy built files to root
Copy-Item -Path "frontend\dist\*" -Destination ".\public\" -Recurse -Force

# If public doesn't exist, create it
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path ".\public\" -Force
```

### Step 2: Update GitHub Pages to Use Root

1. Go to: https://github.com/zyber-jagan/Smart-Resume-Builder-with-AI/settings/pages
2. Change Source to: **"Deploy from a branch"**
3. Branch: **main**
4. Folder: **/public**
5. Click **Save**

---

## Alternative: Simpler Approach

### Option A: Use gh-pages Branch

```powershell
# Install gh-pages
npm install -D gh-pages

# Deploy
npm run deploy
```

Add to package.json:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d frontend/dist"
  }
}
```

### Option B: Manual Upload

1. Open https://github.com/zyber-jagan/Smart-Resume-Builder-with-AI
2. Create folder: **docs** (or use existing)
3. Upload contents of **frontend/dist** to **docs** folder
4. In Settings â†’ Pages, deploy from **docs** folder
