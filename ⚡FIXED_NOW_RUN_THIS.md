# ⚡ FIXED - RUN THIS NOW!

## ✅ Everything is Ready!

Your project is fully set up and ready to run. Follow these simple steps:

---

## 🚀 EASIEST WAY TO RUN (Windows):

### **Option 1: Use the Batch File** ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Double-click this file:**
```
START_ALL.bat
```

This will automatically start both backend and frontend servers!

Then open: **http://localhost:3000**

---

### **Option 2: Manual Start (If Batch File Doesn't Work)**

**Open 2 PowerShell windows:**

**Window 1 (Backend):**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\resume project\backend"
npm start
```

**Window 2 (Frontend):**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\resume project\frontend"
npm run dev
```

**Then open:** http://localhost:3000

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Setup .env File First!

Before running, you MUST create the .env file:

1. **Open Notepad:**
   ```powershell
   notepad backend\.env
   ```

2. **Copy and paste this:**
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/resume_builder
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Get OpenAI Key:**
   - Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Sign up and create API key
   - Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your key

4. **Save the file**
