# 🔧 Fix White Page on GitHub Pages

## Current Issue:
White page on https://zyber-jagan.github.io/Smart-Resume-Builder-with-AI/

## ✅ What I've Already Done:
1. ✅ Updated base path in `vite.config.js` 
2. ✅ Rebuilt the frontend (build successful)
3. ✅ Pushed changes to GitHub

---

## 🚨 Most Likely Issue:

The **GitHub Actions workflow might not be deploying correctly**, or the **Build** job is failing.

---

## 🔍 Check These:

### 1. Check GitHub Actions

Go to: https://github.com/zyber-jagan/Smart-Resume-Builder-with-AI/actions

**Look for:**
- Is there a workflow running?
- Did it complete successfully?
- Any red ❌ errors?

### 2. Check GitHub Pages Settings

1. Go to: https://github.com/zyber-jagan/Smart-Resume-Builder-with-AI/settings/pages
2. Under **Source**: Should be **"Deploy from a branch"** OR **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Make sure it's selected

### 3. Check Browser Console

1. Visit: https://zyber-jagan.github.io/Smart-Resume-Builder-with-AI/
2. Press **F12**
3. Look for errors (red text)
4. Check **Network** tab for failed files

## 🛠️ Try This Fix:

### Option 1: Re-deploy from Settings

1. Go to repository **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select: **"GitHub Actions"**
3. If that's already selected, change to **"Deploy from a branch"**
4. Select branch: **main**
5. Folder: **/ (root)**
6. Click **Save**
7. Wait 2 minutes

### Option 2: Force Re-deploy

```powershell
# Add an empty commit to trigger deployment
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger rebuild"
git push
```

### Option 3: Check Build Output

The issue might be that the GitHub Actions workflow is trying to build but using wrong paths. Let me check the workflow file.
