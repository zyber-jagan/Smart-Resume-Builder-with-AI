# 🚀 SIMPLE DEPLOY - Fix White Page NOW!

## ✅ Quick Solution:

I've added a deployment script. Now do this:

### Run This Command:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run deploy
```

This will:
1. Build your app
2. Deploy to GitHub Pages automatically
3. Make it live in 2-3 minutes

### After Running:

1. Wait 2-3 minutes
2. Visit: https://zyber-jagan.github.io/Smart-Resume-Builder-with-AI/
3. Clear cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)

---

## 🎉 Done!

Your app should now be live and working!

---

## If This Doesn't Work:

### Check GitHub Pages Settings:

1. Go to: https://github.com/zyber-jagan/Smart-Resume-Builder-with-AI/settings/pages
2. Make sure **Source** is set to **"Deploy from a branch"**
3. Select branch: **gh-pages**
4. Folder: **/ (root)**
5. Click **Save**

---

## Alternative: Manual Upload

If the script doesn't work:

1. Go to: https://github.com/zyber-jagan/Smart-Resume-Builder-with-AI
2. Click **Create file** → Name it: **index.html**
3. Open `frontend/dist/index.html` from your project
4. Copy and paste the content
5. Commit
6. Repeat for other files (or upload all at once)
